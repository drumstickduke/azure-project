Use  Custom Vision Prediction of Azure to detect whether the riders were wearing helements. 
If the model detects the probability of wearing a helment or not wearing a helment is greater than 50%, we will use opencv to make a bounding box to circle the head. 
User could interact with Custom Vision Prediction via Line Bot.
